## Translate Table Descriptions

Copilot can perform multi step tasks. In this example it finds [tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview) without a description, suggests descriptions and translates them to Spanish.

## Canvas App Properties

You can ask copilot any question about your [canvas app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started). For example, you can ask it to show list of all apps, who modified an app last and when, what is the app's description, and many more.

## Send Email

Copilot can send an emails to your colleagues as well. At any point during chat just ask copilot to send follow up email about a list, an app, a solution, or a table and it will write an email for you. In example below copilot Assistant finds [unmanaged solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#managed-and-unmanaged-solutions) and sends an email to the owner with a AI generated question.

## Interact with Power Platform Environments

Copilot makes it easier and faster to switch between environments in Power Platform and apply same filters across different environments. In example below, I have two environments, one DevTools and the other one is ProDov. I ask to list environments published by Microsoft but then I ask to execute same query in ProDov environment. Copilot will automatically switch to ProDov environment and execute the query.
